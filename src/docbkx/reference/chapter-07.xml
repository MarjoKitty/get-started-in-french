	<para>In Unit 2 (???) you've already seen how to ask for things using just a few words.
	Getting precisely what you need may involve giving a few more details. This unit will provide
	you with some of the key words you'll need to describe what you are looking for, specifying colours,
	materials, quantities, prices, etc. There is a lot of new vocabulary in this unit, appearing in
	the sections <b>Key words and phrases</b>, <b>Grammar</b> and <b>Activities</b>. It will be useful
	to you when doing Unit 11 (???) which concentrates on the topic of shopping in France.</para>
