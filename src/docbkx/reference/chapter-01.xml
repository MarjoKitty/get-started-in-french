		<section><title>HOW TO BE COURTEOUS</title>
			<para>In France when you're talking to someone you don't know very well, it's polite to add
			<b>Monsieur</b>, <b>Madame</b>, <b>Mademoiselle</b> particularly after short phrases like
			<b>oui</b>, <b>non</b>, <b>bonjour</b> or <b>merci</b>.</para>
			<para>The French shake hands with good friends and acquaintances every time they meet or say
			goodbye. Kissing (on both cheeks) is reserved for family and close friends.</para>
		</section>
		<section><title>WHEN TO USE TU (YOU) AND WHEN TO USE VOUS (YOU)</title>
			<para>The equivalent of <i>you</i> in French can be either <b>tu</b> or <b>vous</b>. French
			people use <b>tu</b> when speaking to children, teenagers, relations and close friends.
			They use <b>vous</b> in work and business situations or when speaking to senior or old
			people: <b>vous</b> is also used to address a group of people to whom one might say <b>tu</b>
			individually. The best advice is to say <b>vous</b> until you are addressed as <b>tu</b>
			or asked to use the <b>tu</b> form: <b>on se tutoie?</b> <i>shall we call each other <b>tu</b>?</i></para>
